Content: The violation(s)in question, despite the voluntary nature of the disclosure, may 
merit penalties, admin istrative actions, and sanctions to consider criminal 
prosecution. The IMWG will consider whether ‘voluntary disclosure,’ in the 
context of other relevant information in a particular case, should be a mitigating 
factor in determining, if any, administrativ e action will be imposed. Some of the 
other factors the IMWG may consider in case of voluntary disclosure include: 
i. Whether the export would have been authorized in the normal course, and 
under what conditions (voluntary / forced disclosure) the request for  export 
authorization has been made by the exporter before DGFT; 
ii. Whether the violation was intentional or inadvertent, systematic or not; 
iii. Why the violation occurred; 
iv. The degree of cooperation with the ensuing verification/investigation; 
v. Whether the firm ha s instituted or improved an internal trade compliance 
mechanism/process/program, including training of employees to reduce the 
likelihood of future export violation(s); 
vi. Whether the export violation was in the knowledge of senior management of 
the organization; 
vii. The degree to which the firm / authorized person responsible for the 
violation was familiar with the export control laws and regulations; 
viii. Whether the firm has violated export control laws and regulations in the past; 
 B.  Procedure for Voluntary Disclosure: 
i. Any individual/firm should initially notify the Directorate General of Foreign 
Trade (DGFT) immediately after an export violation is discovered and 
confirmed internally, and then conduct a thorough review of all such trade 
activities where a violati on is suspected. The Indian exporter must submit all 
the relevant details of such violation (in Appendix 10O) to SCOMET Division, 
DGFT (Hqrs), Vanjiya Bhawan, New Delhi, via E-mail at scomet-dgft@nic.in 
ii. If there is confirmation from the relevant enforcemen t agencies such as 
Customs or through other sources regarding such violation by the exporting 
entity or individual, a show cause notice shall be issued by SCOMET Cell, 
DGFT to the applicant firm. A full disclosure along with all the necessary 
documents must be submitted within 30 days or the extended time as may be 
specified. 
iii. Failure to provide a full disclosure within a reasonable time may result in a 
recommendation by the IMWG, not to consider the Voluntary Disclosure as a 
mitigating factor in determining  the appropriate disposition of the violation. 
In addition, DGFT may direct the firm to furnish all the relevant information 
surrounding the violation in terms of the relevant Indian laws and 
regulations.

(iii) If request for issue of waiver of Bond/EODC was not considered within the 
period specified under Para 11.10 of HBP, where complete application was 
submitted within the validity of the Authorisation. 
In such cases, revalidation shall be allowed from the date of endorsement for the period 
of delay or six months, whichever is less. For example: Authorisation is issued having 
initial validity of 12 months on 01.04.2017. It was transmitted to Customs serve r on 
01.04.2017 by DGFT server but it is accepted by Customs server on 31.10.2017. So, the 
Authorisation holder loses 7 months (still 5 months validity is  left). In such a case, RA 
shall allow revalidation for a period of 6 months (validity of 5 months is subsumed) 
from the date of endorsement. 
The applicant shall submit request for endorsement of Authorisation/Scrip along with 
screen shot of DGFT server as well as Customs Server in support of his claim. RA shall 
verify the same before revalidation is allowed. 
However, request must be made to RA concerned within a month from the date of final 
acceptance of Authorisation/Scrip in the Customs Server. 
Notwithstanding anything contained above, these provisions of revalidation shall not 
apply wherever, the authorisation/scrip holder had clear 6 months period in hand for 
utilisation.

LDCs through its Duty Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) Scheme for LDCs which came into 
effect in August, 2008 with tariff reductions spread over five years. The Scheme 
provided preferential market access on tariff lines that comprise 92.5% of global

Developing Districts as Export Hubs  
3.01  Policy 
Policy for Developing Districts as Export hubs is given in Chapter 3 of FTP. 
3.02  Objective of policy 
To convert each District of the country into an Export Hub by identifying products 
with export potential in the District, addressing bottlenecks for exporting these 
products, supporting local exporters/manufacturers to scale and find potential buyers 
outside India with the aim of promoting exports, manufacturing and services industry 
in the District. To enable a conducive foreign trade environment, any policy strategy 
to boost exports formulated by the Central Government can only be effectively 
implemented with the collaboration of State Governments and the District 
Administration. Earlier, export promotion was a subject, primarily dealt by only the 
Central government, without any active mechanism involving the State or District 
level stakeholders into the decision making to promote goods and services produced 
at the grassroots level. The export promotion activity needs to be decentralized, for 
both formulation and implementation purposes, with an objective to boost local 
production and make Districts active stakeholders in driving export of local 
products/services.  
3.03  District Export Promotion Committees -Institutional Mechanism at 
District Level 
Each District has a District Export Promotion Committee (DEPC) which is mostly 
chaired by Collector/DM/DC of the District and co-chaired by designated DGFT 
Regional Authority with various other stakeholders as its members.

The primary function of the DEPC will be to prepare and implement District specific 
Export Action Plans in collaboration with all the relevant stakeholders from the 
Center, State and the District level. 
The preliminary exercise may include an assessment of a district to identify the 
current export profile, its further potential in the district, quantifiable targets to 
increase export performance from the District. This involves identifying and 
promoting products, which are currently being exported from there, and also 
identifying and promoting new products in the district with untapped export 
potential. These efforts are to be taken forward through an institutional mechanism to 
undertake a baseline study across goods and services, to map current export activities 
and the future potential along with the infrastructure and other constraints and 
bottlenecks that would need to be addressed to achieve this potential.

only 50% quantity wise but import has been for complete CIF value 
permitted, then Value Addition would be calculated on a pro- rata basis, 
i.e., with reference to 50% of CIF value of imports.  This would, 
accordingly, imply that where Authorisation holder is unable to export, 
no penalty on value wise shortfall shall be imposed.

3.0 Objective
To galvanise districts of the country to become export hubs 
by identifying products and services with export potential 
in the district, addressing bottlenecks for exporting 
these products/services, supporting local exporters/
manufacturers to scale and find potential buyers outside 
India with the aim of promoting exports, manufacturing & 
services industry in the District. This is intended to bring 
greater level of awareness and commitment regarding 
exports at the district level, build capacity to create new 
exporters and identify new markets for the focused products 
and services. This will also empower MSMEs, farmers and 
small scale industries to get benefit of export opportunities 
in the overseas markets. This decentralised and focused 
approach will shift the focus on district led export growth 
for self-sufficiency and self- reliance by providing global 
platform to products and services from the districts. 
3.1 District Export Promotion Committees - 
Institutional Mechanism at District Level
Every district has products and services which are being 
exported, and can be further promoted, along with new 
products / services, to increase production, grow exports, 
generate economic activity and achieve the goal of 
AtmaNirbhar Bharat, Vocal for local and Make in India.  
Products/services (GI products, agricultural clusters, toy 
clusters etc.) with export potential in each District have to be 
identified and institutional mechanism in the form of District 
Export Promotion Committees (DEPCs) at the district level is 
to be created to provide support for export promotion and 
address the bottlenecks for export growth in the Districts.
Each District shall constitute a District Export Promotion 
Committee (DEPC) chaired by Collector/DM/DC of the 
District and co-chaired by designated DGFT Regional 
Authority with various other stakeholders as its members. 
The primary function of the DEPC will be to prepare 
and implement district specific Export Action Plans in 
collaboration with all the relevant stakeholders at the 
Central, State and the District level.
DGFT Regional Authorities will be engaging with all the 
relevant State and Central agencies to take forward this 
initiative in each district. 
3.2  District Export Action Plans for Each 
District
The District Export Action Plan (DEAP) may be prepared 
for each district. 2-3 high potential products/services from 
the districts may be prioritised and comprehensive plan 
for their export growth may be prepared. It may include

the support required by the local industry in boosting their 
manufacturing and exports with impetus on supporting the 
industry from the production stage to the exporting stage. 
The DEAPs may also include specific quantifiable targets 
to be achieved in the short term and long term. These 
plans may outline the interventions that are required to 
promote the export of identified products and services from 
the district. Each DEAP may be deliberated by the DEPC 
and various stakeholders before it is formally adopted by 
the DEPC of the each District. DEAP of each District, once 
adopted, may be published in the public domain on a 
dedicated Portal.  
3.3  State/UT Export Promotion Committees
To synergise the efforts of the Department of Commerce/
DGFT and the State/UT governments in promotion of 
exports from the State, each State shall constitute a State 
Export Promotion Committee (SEPC) headed by Chief 
Secretary of the State. The designated Regional Authority of 
DGFT shall be the co-convener of the committee. 
3.4  Nodal DGFT Regional Authority
Districts of the States/UTs have been assigned to the 
Jurisdictional DGFT Regional Authority and the nodal RA 
shall be responsible for the Districts under their jurisdiction 
for all activities related to Districts as Export Hubs initiative 
in those Districts. 
3.5  Online Monitoring of District Export 
Action Plans 
DGFT would develop an online monitoring portal that 
may be accessed on the DGFT website to enable the 
States/ DGFT RAs to upload all information related to the 
products/services with export potential of every District. The 
portal may also help in monitoring the progress of District 
Export Action Plan and DEPC meetings in all the Districts. 
Each DGFT Jurisdictional RA to be primarily responsible for 
updating the information/progress made in implementing 
Export Action Plan for each District under their Jurisdiction. 
The information and reports may also be available in public 
domain for the benefit of the exporters.   
3.6  Export Promotion Activities in Districts
Support in the form of product/sector specific training and 
development needs of local industries, dissemination of 
information through outreach activities including buyer-
seller meets, trade fairs, workshops etc. may be provided 
in each District. The training and development needs of 
District industries may be identified and trainings may be 
coordinated with other departments. DGFT RAs through 
DEPCs may facilitate such buyer-seller meets, exhibitions, 
trade fairs etc. in the District to encourage the industries to 
showcase their products/services to the world.
3.7  Implementation of District Export 
Action Plans 
The District Export Action Plan notified by the District Export 
Promotion Committee in each District may include clear 
identification of products (goods and services) with export 
potential in the District, institutional/other responsibilities, 
specifics of policy, regulatory and operational reform, 
and infrastructure/utilities/logistics interventions required 
across the entire chain from producer/farm to the export 
destination, to cover aspects like production, productivity/
competitiveness, improvements required in design, tie up 
of producers with exporters, aggregation, sorting, testing, 
certification, packaging, transportation through cold chain 
or otherwise, import export regulatory formalities, fulfilment 
of destination countries standards etc. It may also include 
Identifying bottlenecks/Issues in GI production, registration, 
marketing and its exports. The plan may also include the 
support required by the local industry in boosting their 
manufacturing and exports with impetus on supporting the 
industry from the production stage to the exporting stage.  
Once the plan is formally adopted by the DEPC of the 
each District, the plan may be implemented by the DEPC 
by identifying the projects/activities required to be done to 
promote export growth from the Districts. Convergence of 
various schemes would be done on priority to build synergy 
and access the central government and State government 
scheme funds available for infrastructure development and 
skill/capacity building activities. Department of Commerce 
schemes such as Market Access Initiative, Niryat Bandhu 
scheme etc. may also give priority to district specific needs 
identified under the District Export Action Plan.

Content: iii. The determination of ceiling rates under the Scheme 
will be done by a Committee in the Department of 
Revenue/Drawback Division with suitable 
representation of the DoC/DGFT, line ministries and 
experts, on the sectors prioritized by Department of 
Commerce and Department of Revenue. 
iv. The overall budget/outlay for the RoDTEP Scheme 
would be finalized by the Ministry of Finance in 
consultation with Department of Commerce (DoC), 
taking into account all relevant factors. 
v. The Scheme will operate in a Budgetary framework 
for each financial year and necessary calibrations 
and revisions shall be made to the Scheme benefits, 
as and when required, so that the projected 
remissions for each financial year are managed 
within the approved Budget of the Scheme. No 
provision for remission of arrears or contingent 
liabilities is permissible under the Scheme to be 
carried over to the next financial year. 
vi. The sequence of introduction of the Scheme across 
sectors, prioritization of the sectors to be covered, 
degree of benefit to be given on various items within 
the rates recommended by the Committee and within  
a ceiling as may be prescribed, on the per item/total 
overall benefit amount permissible, within the overall 
budget/ outlay finalized, will be decided and 
notified by the Department of Commerce (DoC) in 
consultation with Department of Revenue. 
vii. Under the Scheme, a rebate would be granted to 
eligible exporters at a notified rate as a percentage 
of FOB value with a value cap per unit of the 
exported product, wherever required, on export of 
items which are categorized under the notified 8 
digit HS Code. However, for certain export items, a 
fixed quantum of rebate amount per unit may also 
be notified. Rates of rebate / value cap per unit 
under RoDTEP will be notified in Appendix 4R. In 
addition to necessary changes which may be brought 
in view of budget control measures as mentioned 
above, efforts would be made to review the RoDTEP 
rates on an annual basis and to notify them well in 
advance before the beginning of a financial year. 
viii. The rebate allowed is subject to the receipt of sale 
proceeds within time allowed under the Foreign  
Exchange Management Act, 1999 failing which  such 
rebate shall be deemed never to have been 
allowed. The rebate would not be dependent on the 
realization of export proceeds at the time of 
issue of rebate. However, adequate safeguards to 
avoid any misuse on account of non-realization and 
other systemic improvements as in operation under 
Drawback Scheme, IGST and other GST refunds 
relating to exports would also be applicable for 
claims made under the RoDTEP Scheme. 
ix. Mechanism of Issuance of Rebate: Scheme would be 
implemented through end to end digitization of 
issuance of rebate amount in the form of a 
transferable duty credit/electronic scrip (e-scrip), 
which will be maintained in an electronic ledger by 
the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs 
(CBIC). Necessary rules  and procedure regarding 
grant of RoDTEP claim under the Scheme and 
implementation issues including manner of 
application, time period for application and other 
matters including export realization, export 
documentation, sampling procedures, record keeping 
etc. would be notified by the CBIC, Department of 
Revenue on an IT enabled platform with a view to 
end to end digitization. Necessary provisions for 
recovery of rebate amount where foreign exchange 
is not realized, suspension/withholding of RoDTEP in 
case of frauds  and misuse, as well as imposition of 
penalty will also be built suitably by CBIC. 
x.  The Scheme will take effect for exports from 1st 
January 2021. However for exports made by 
categories under Para  4.55 (x), (xi) and (xii), the 
implementation date will  be decided later as per 
provisions of Para 4.55B.

Content: 10.01 Brief Background 
India is a signatory to international conventions on 
disarmament and non -proliferation, viz. the Chemical 
Weapons Convention (CWC) and Biological and Toxin 
Weapons Convention (BWC). The United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1540 obliges all countries to prohibit 
access of weapons and mass destruction and their delivery 
systems to non -state actors (in particular for terrorist 
purposes); and prescribed measures and controls on 
weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and 
related materials, equipment and technology. India is also 
a member of the major multilateral export control regimes, 
viz. the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), 
Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) and Australia Group (AG); 
and has harmonized its guidelines and control lists with 
that of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). In consonance 
with the guidelines and control lists of these international 
conventions and obligations as well as multilateral export 
control regimes, India has regulated the exports of dual 
use items, nuclear related items, including software and 
technology. 
In respect of controls on export of specified goods, services 
and technology, the Weapons of Mass Destruction and 
their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) 
Act, 2005 (21 of 2005) shall apply to exports, transfers, 
re-transfers, brought in transit, trans -shipment of, and 
brokering in specified goods, technology or services. 
These provisions have been incorporated in Chapter IVA of 
Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992, as 
amended in 2010.

due to insolvency or default of the buyer. Additionally, 
losses due to political risk like war, sudden import 
restriction, promulgation of law or decree after the 
shipment has been affected are also covered. Some of 
the anti- dumping measures or non-tariff barriers 
introduced after a shipment has been made will come 
under the purview of the political risk. In such cases 
exporter’s interest are protected by ECGC.
